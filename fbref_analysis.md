IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
======================

HIGH PRIORITY (Core Missing Stats):
1. Advanced shooting metrics (shots by type, location)
2. Pressure/pressing statistics  
3. Key passes and passing into dangerous areas
4. Set piece statistics
5. Detailed possession metrics (carries, distances)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced Analytics):
1. Playing time breakdowns
2. Positional touch statistics
3. Advanced defensive metrics
4. Error tracking
5. Goalkeeper advanced metrics

LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
1. Highly granular stats (nutmegs, specific shot types)
2. Detailed disciplinary tracking
3. Weather/pitch condition data

RECOMMENDED DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATES
===================================

We should add these fields to our Pydantic models to capture the full
richness of FBref data for advanced football analytics and machine learning.

This will enable:
- More accurate match prediction models
- Detailed player performance analysis  
- Comprehensive referee bias studies
- Advanced team tactical analysis
- Player recruitment analytics
