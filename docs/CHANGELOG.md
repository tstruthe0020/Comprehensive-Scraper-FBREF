# Technical Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 - Major Browser Automation Migration
**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready

---

## üöÄ **MAJOR CHANGES**

### **Browser Automation Migration: Selenium ‚Üí Playwright**

#### **Problem Resolved**
- **ChromeDriver ARM64 Incompatibility:** Version mismatch between Chromium 137 and ChromeDriver 134
- **Installation Issues:** ChromeDriver ARM64 binaries not available for latest versions
- **Crash Issues:** Chrome process crashes with unknown stack traces on ARM64

#### **Solution Implemented**
- **Playwright Integration:** Complete migration to Playwright for browser automation
- **ARM64 Support:** Native ARM64 compatibility with automatic browser binary management
- **Stability Improvement:** Eliminated all ChromeDriver-related crashes and errors

#### **Technical Details**
```python
# OLD: Selenium + ChromeDriver
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=chrome_options)

# NEW: Playwright
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=True)
page = await browser.new_page()
```

## üîó **URL STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Dynamic Season Management**
- **Current Season Detection:** Date-based logic for current vs historical seasons
- **URL Pattern Recognition:** Different URL structures for current and historical data
- **Season Transition Logic:** Automatic transition on August 1st each year

#### **URL Patterns Discovered & Implemented**
```
Current Season (2024-25):
https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/schedule/Premier-League-Scores-and-Fixtures

Historical Seasons:
https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2023-2024/schedule/2023-2024-Premier-League-Scores-and-Fixtures
```

#### **Implementation Features**
- **Automatic Format Conversion:** `"2023-24"` ‚Üí `"2023-2024"` for historical URLs
- **Date-based Current Season:** Dynamic detection without hardcoding
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Complete URL reference guide created
