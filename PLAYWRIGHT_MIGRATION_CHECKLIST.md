# üé≠ Playwright Migration & Scraping Fix Checklist
## Comprehensive Task Tracking for FBRef Scraping Issues

**Created:** June 2025  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Estimated Completion:** 3-4 hours  

---

## üìä **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **Current State Assessment**
- ‚úÖ Playwright imports present in server.py  
- ‚úÖ Basic Playwright browser setup implemented
- ‚úÖ Season fixtures extraction working (1000+ match links found)
- üö® **CRITICAL:** Mixed Selenium/Playwright code causing session failures
- üö® **CRITICAL:** Unvalidated HTML selectors preventing data extraction
- üö® **CRITICAL:** Zero real match data successfully stored in database

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Incomplete Migration:** Selenium methods still used in key scraping functions
2. **Session Management:** No recovery logic for long-running tasks  
3. **HTML Assumptions:** Current selectors based on assumptions, not real FBref analysis
4. **Error Handling:** Limited error recovery and retry mechanisms

## üöÄ **PHASE 1: COMPLETE PLAYWRIGHT MIGRATION**

### **1.1 Remove Selenium Dependencies**
- [x] **Task:** Remove Selenium imports from server.py (lines 16-22)
  - [x] `from selenium import webdriver`
  - [x] `from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service`
  - [x] `from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options`
  - [x] `from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By`
  - [x] `from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait`
  - [x] `from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC`
  - [x] `from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException, NoSuchElementException`
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 5 minutes (Actual: 3 minutes)
- [x] **Dependencies:** None
- **Notes:** Removed all Selenium imports and unused Selenium-based methods. Updated error message to reference Playwright.

### **1.2 Convert extract_match_links() Method**
- [x] **Task:** Replace Selenium calls in `extract_match_links()` method (lines 242-269)
  - [x] Replace `self.driver.get(fixtures_url)` with `await self.page.goto(fixtures_url)`
  - [x] Replace `self.driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "a")` with Playwright selector
  - [x] Update link extraction logic for Playwright
  - [x] Test with real season URL
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Method removed - using extract_season_fixtures instead)
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes (Actual: Already done)
- [x] **Dependencies:** 1.1 completed
- **Notes:** Removed redundant extract_match_links() method. Code already uses extract_season_fixtures() with Playwright.

### **1.3 Convert scrape_match_report() Method**
- [x] **Task:** Replace Selenium calls in `scrape_match_report()` method (lines 410-470)
  - [x] Replace `self.driver.get(match_url)` with `await self.page.goto(match_url)`
  - [x] Replace `self.driver.page_source` with `await self.page.content()`
  - [x] Update method to be async
  - [x] Fix all callers to use await
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Method removed - using scrape_real_match_data_playwright instead)
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes (Actual: Already done)
- [x] **Dependencies:** 1.1, 1.2 completed
- **Notes:** Removed redundant scrape_match_report() method. Code already uses scrape_real_match_data_playwright() with Playwright.

### **1.4 Implement Session Recovery Logic**
- [x] **Task:** Add robust browser session management
  - [x] Create `ensure_browser_session()` method
  - [x] Add session validation before each operation
  - [x] Implement automatic session recovery
  - [x] Add session health monitoring
  - [x] Create `navigate_with_retry()` method with exponential backoff
  - [x] Update `extract_season_fixtures()` to use session recovery
  - [x] Update `scrape_real_match_data_playwright()` to use session recovery
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes (Actual: 25 minutes)
- [x] **Dependencies:** 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 completed
- **Notes:** Added comprehensive session management with health checks, automatic recovery, and retry logic with exponential backoff.

## üîç **PHASE 2: HTML STRUCTURE VALIDATION**

### **2.1 Create Single Match Analysis Script**
- [x] **Task:** Build standalone script to analyze match report structure
  - [x] Create `/app/single_match_analyzer.py`
  - [x] Test URL: `https://fbref.com/en/matches/9c4f2bcd/Brentford-West-Ham-United-September-28-2024-Premier-League`
  - [x] Log complete HTML structure (tables, divs, IDs)
  - [x] Identify all available data elements
  - [x] Create detailed analysis with `detailed_match_analyzer.py`
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes (Actual: 35 minutes)
- [x] **Dependencies:** Phase 1 completed
- **Notes:** Created comprehensive analysis scripts. Found critical issues with current selectors.

### **2.2 Document Real HTML Structure**
- [x] **Task:** Create comprehensive HTML documentation
  - [x] Map all table IDs and classes (14 stats tables identified)
  - [x] Document scorebox structure (div.scorebox works, but team names use different selector)
  - [x] Identify team stats locations (pattern: stats_{team_id}_{category})
  - [x] Identify player stats locations (individual player tables)
  - [x] Document metadata elements (referee, stadium, etc.)
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 20 minutes (Actual: Already done during analysis)
- [x] **Dependencies:** 2.1 completed
- **Notes:** Documented in detailed_structure_report.json. Team IDs: cd051869 (Brentford), 7c21e445 (West Ham).

### **2.3 Validate Current Selectors**
- [x] **Task:** Test existing CSS selectors against real HTML
  - [x] Test `div.scorebox` selector (‚úÖ WORKS)
  - [x] Test `table[id*="stats"]` selectors (‚úÖ WORKS - 14 tables found)
  - [x] Test team name extraction logic (‚ùå FAILS - wrong selector)
  - [x] Test score extraction logic (‚úÖ WORKS)
  - [x] Document which selectors work vs fail
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes (Actual: Already done during analysis)
- [x] **Dependencies:** 2.1, 2.2 completed
- **Notes:** Critical findings: team names need `a[href*='/squads/']`, possession data not in expected location.

### **2.4 Update Selector Logic**
- [x] **Task:** Fix selectors based on real HTML analysis
  - [x] Update `extract_match_metadata()` method (use squad links for team names)
  - [x] Update `extract_team_stats()` method (use correct table ID patterns)
  - [x] Add `_get_team_id_from_tables()` helper method
  - [x] Add `_extract_team_summary_from_table()` helper method  
  - [x] Add `_calculate_team_totals_from_players()` helper method
  - [x] Add fallback selectors for robustness
- [x] **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes (Actual: 35 minutes)
- [x] **Dependencies:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 completed
- **Notes:** Completely rewrote data extraction logic based on validated HTML structure. Team names from squad links, team stats from pattern stats_{team_id}_{category}.
