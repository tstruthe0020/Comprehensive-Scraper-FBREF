## 🔄 **DATA FLOW & CONNECTIONS**

### **Scraping Workflow**
```
1. User selects scraping mode (Single/Multi/Team-Focused)
2. User configures seasons and optional team filter
3. Frontend calls API: POST /api/scrape-season/{season} or /api/scrape-team-multi-season
4. Backend creates scraping task with unique status_id
5. Background process starts:
   a. ChromeDriver navigates to FBref season page
   b. Extracts match report URLs from fixtures
   c. For each match:
      - Navigates to match report page
      - Extracts comprehensive team statistics (80+ fields)
      - Extracts individual player statistics (75+ fields) 
      - Stores data in MongoDB
      - Updates progress status
6. Frontend polls progress: GET /api/scraping-status/{status_id}
7. Real-time UI updates show live progress
8. On completion, data available in analytics tabs
```

### **Analytics Workflow**
```
1. User navigates to Team Analytics or Player Analytics tab
2. User applies filters (season, team, position)
3. Frontend calls API: GET /api/team-matches or /api/player-matches
4. Backend queries MongoDB with filters
5. Data returned and displayed in enhanced tables
6. User can sort, analyze, and interact with data
7. Export option available for comprehensive CSV download
```

### **Export Workflow**
```
1. User selects export type (Team Data vs Player Data)
2. User configures filters (seasons, teams)
3. Frontend calls API: POST /api/export-team-csv or /api/export-player-csv
4. Backend queries MongoDB with filters
5. Data converted to pandas DataFrame
6. CSV generated with all 80+ or 75+ statistical fields
7. File streamed to frontend for download
8. User receives comprehensive dataset file
```

## 🔧 **SCRAPING ENGINE DETAILS**

### **FBrefScraperV2 Class Architecture**
```python
class FBrefScraperV2:
    # Core Methods
    setup_driver()                    # ChromeDriver ARM64 configuration
    get_season_fixtures_url()         # Generate season URLs
    extract_match_links()             # Extract match report URLs
    scrape_season()                   # Full season scraping workflow
    scrape_match_report()             # Individual match extraction
    
    # Team Statistics Extraction  
    extract_comprehensive_team_stats() # Main team stats extraction
    _extract_team_stats_from_table()   # Parse specific stat tables
    _parse_team_row_by_stat_type()     # Type-specific parsing logic
    _extract_from_general_tables()     # Fallback extraction methods
    
    # Player Statistics Extraction
    extract_comprehensive_player_stats() # Main player stats extraction  
    _extract_players_from_team_table()   # Team-specific player extraction
    _parse_player_row()                   # Individual player parsing
    _extract_players_fallback()           # Fallback player extraction
    
    # Utility Methods
    _parse_int(), _parse_float()       # Data type conversions
    _parse_percentage()                # Percentage handling
    extract_match_metadata()           # Match info extraction
```

### **Smart Table Parsing Logic**
```python
# FBref Table ID Patterns
stat_tables = {
    'summary': f'stats_summary_{team_id}',           # Core match stats
    'passing': f'stats_passing_{team_id}',           # Passing statistics  
    'passing_types': f'stats_passing_types_{team_id}', # Pass type breakdown
    'defense': f'stats_defense_{team_id}',           # Defensive actions
    'possession': f'stats_possession_{team_id}',     # Possession metrics
    'misc': f'stats_misc_{team_id}',                 # Miscellaneous stats
    'keeper': f'stats_keeper_{team_id}'              # Goalkeeper stats
}

# Fallback Mechanisms
- Multiple team name formats (spaces, hyphens, underscores)
- Alternative table naming conventions
- General table parsing when specific tables not found
- Robust error handling with continued processing
```

## 📋 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **ChromeDriver Issues**
```bash
# Problem: ChromeDriver not found or incompatible
# Solution: Install correct ARM64 version
sudo apt install chromium chromium-driver
which chromium chromedriver  # Verify installation

# Problem: Browser crashes during scraping
# Solution: Increase system resources, check memory usage
free -h  # Check available memory
sudo systemctl restart mongodb  # Restart services if needed
```

#### **Database Issues**
```python
# Problem: MongoDB connection errors
# Solution: Verify MongoDB is running and accessible
sudo systemctl status mongodb
mongo --eval "db.adminCommand('ismaster')"  # Test connection

# Problem: Slow query performance
# Solution: Add database indexes
db.team_matches.createIndex({"season": 1, "team_name": 1})
db.player_matches.createIndex({"season": 1, "team_name": 1, "player_name": 1})
```

#### **API Issues**
```python
# Problem: 500 errors during scraping
# Solution: Check backend logs and ChromeDriver status
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log

# Problem: Frontend can't connect to backend
# Solution: Verify environment variables and network connectivity
curl http://localhost:8001/api/  # Test API accessibility
```

**This Enhanced FBref Multi-Season Team & Player Analytics Scraper represents a sophisticated, production-ready platform for advanced football data analysis and research.**

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL PROJECT REQUIREMENT**

**REAL DATA ONLY POLICY:**
- This project MUST use real scraped data from FBref.com ONLY
- Under NO circumstances should sample/mock/generated data be used
- All data must be authentic football statistics extracted from actual FBref match reports
- Any implementation using fake/sample data violates the core purpose of this analytics platform
- The ChromeDriver scraping engine must be functional and extract real match data

---

## 🚀 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Browser Automation: Playwright (ARM64 Compatible)**
- **Migration Completed:** Switched from problematic Selenium + ChromeDriver to Playwright
- **ARM64 Compatibility:** Full support for ARM64 architecture without version conflicts
- **Browser Management:** Automatic Chromium binary management and setup
- **Stability:** Resolved all ChromeDriver crashes and compatibility issues

### **URL Structure & Season Management**
- **Dynamic Season Detection:** Automatic current vs historical season determination
- **Date-based Logic:** Current season until August 1st, then transitions to next season
- **Proper URL Construction:** Different URL patterns for current and historical seasons
- **Reference Documentation:** Complete URL patterns stored in `/docs/fbref-url-structure.md`

### **Data Extraction Pipeline**
1. **Season Fixtures Page** → Extract all match links for a season
2. **Individual Match Reports** → Scrape comprehensive team and player statistics  
3. **Database Storage** → Store 155+ statistical fields per match in MongoDB
4. **API Access** → REST endpoints for data retrieval and analysis
